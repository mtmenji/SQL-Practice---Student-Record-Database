# Overview
{This is my first ever SQL personal project. After spending a week learning SQL basics, SQLite3, and integrating use into the VSCode IDE, I created this project.}

{This project takes a few tables that I have created for students, classes they are in, and extracurricular activities they participate in. Then, at the bottom, I showcased my SQL Query knowledge by creating complex queries looking for specific answers and outputting it into the terminal using Python.}

# Relational Database
{I created a database called students. The tables are called student, history, math, football, dance, and band.}

# Development Environment
{I used MySQL Workbench to learn how to use SQL. For the project, I used VSCode as the IDE, Python as the coding language, and the SQLite3 library to allow SQL inside the Python file.}

# Future Work

{Below is a list of items that could be used to improve on this code:}

- Add more students to the table to increase opportunities for data analysis research.
- Add more tables for different years to make it more applicable for a full middle school.
